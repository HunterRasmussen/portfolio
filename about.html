        <p id = "text1">Hi, I'm Hunter Rasmussen. I'm currently a student finishing
         up my undergrad in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics.
         If you would like to see my r&eacutesum&eacute, click  
         <a href = "docs/resume_rasmussen.pdf" id = "resumeLink">here</a>.  
         I currently work as a videographer for the athletics program at 
         Brigham Young University where I storyboard, film, and edit
         promotional, film NCAA sporting events, and edit game highlights. 
         I love learning almost all new things and am especially interested in philosophy,
         computer science, and mathematics. </p>

        <p> I also love art.  I like thinking about ways that science and art are 
          related.  I mostly like 3d-modeling and texturing, but I like to practice
          my sketching, animating, and any other mediums of creative expression.

        <p>I spent an extravagant amount of time in high school making short films.
          For me it was a great way to tell stories in funny or unique ways and taught me
          how to get through long projects without giving up.  It also taught me how
          to critique myself without being hyper critical or unfair about it.
