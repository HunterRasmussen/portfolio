          just finished my undergrad in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics.
         If you would like to see my r&eacutesum&eacute, click  
         <a href = "docs/resume_rasmussen.pdf" id = "resumeLink">here</a>.
         I'm currently looking for employment as a software or web developer and am 
         currently most interested in 3D computer graphics and computer vision. 
         I love learning almost all new things and am especially interested in philosophy,
         computer science, and mathematics. I also love art.  I like thinking about ways 
         that science and art are related.  I mostly like 3d-modeling and texturing, but 
         I like to practice my sketching, animating, and any other mediums of creative 
         expression. I spent an extravagant amount of time in high school making short films.
         For me it was a great way to tell stories in funny or unique ways and taught me
         how to get through long projects without giving up.  It also taught me how
         to critique myself without being hyper critical or unfair about it. If you'd like to
         hear more about me or have any questions about my interests, feel free to email me.</p>
